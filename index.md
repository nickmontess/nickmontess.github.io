### CPSC 120 

* Lab 2 

    Lab 2, Part 1 Was a favortie of mine becasue it really showed how computers are able to identify the correct orders to solve a mathematical equation. 

* Lab 4, Part 2 

    Lab 4, Part 2 is my personal favortie, this lab resulted in building a little guessing game and truly showed how complex it is to build even a simple game. 
    
* Lab 10, Part 2 really made me use my brain and it was the first time i was able to use 2D vectors and showed how usefull they are.
