### CPSC 120 

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-02-nicholas-kayla-jeremiah.git)

    Lab 2, Part 1 Was a favortie of mine becasue it really showed how computers are able to identify the correct orders to solve a mathematical equation. 

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-jeremiah-and-nicolas)

    Lab 4, Part 2 is my personal favortie, this lab resulted in building a little guessing game and truly showed how complex it is to build even a simple game. 

* [lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-ben-and-nick)

    Lab 10, Part 2 really made me use my brain and it was the first time i was able to use 2D vectors and showed how usefull they are.
